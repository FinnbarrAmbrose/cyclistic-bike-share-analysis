    "**Why:** Casual riders peak on weekends and are more leisure-oriented.\n",
    "**Action:**\n",
    "- Create weekend-focused membership promotions:\n",
    "  - “Weekend Pass converts to annual membership”\n",
    "  - “First month membership discount for riders with 3+ weekend rides”\n",
    "**Expected impact:** Capture casual riders during their highest engagement window.\n",

    "**Why:** Casual riders often ride at predictable leisure times.\n",
    "**Action:**\n",
    "- After a ride, prompt:\n",
    "  - “You’ve spent £X this month — membership would have saved you £Y”\n",
    "- Run station QR promotions near high-traffic tourist / waterfront stations (if applicable).\n",
    "**Expected impact:** Convert riders through real-time cost framing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 3 — Membership Bundles for Long Rides / Premium Bikes\n",
    "**Why:** Casual riders take longer rides; they may prefer comfort or electric bikes.\n",

    "- Offer:\n",
    "  - “Electric upgrade membership tier”\n",
    "  - “Unlimited 60-min rides included”\n",
    "**Expected impact:** Align membership value to leisure/tourist usage, not just commuting.\n"

    "This analysis used **one month** of data (May 2024). To improve decision quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expand to 12 months**\n",
    "   - Confirm whether trends hold across seasons (summer vs winter demand)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add station-level analysis**\n",
    "   - Identify top conversion-target stations (tourist clusters, parks, downtown commuter hubs)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Estimate revenue impact**\n",
    "   - Use pricing assumptions to estimate:\n",
    "     - revenue per casual ride\n",
    "     - cost-to-serve differences\n",
    "     - break-even conversion rate for campaigns\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Segment casual riders**\n",
    "   - Separate likely commuter-casual vs tourist-casual:\n",
    "     - ride length\n",
    "     - time-of-day\n",
    "     - repeat frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **A/B test marketing campaigns**\n",
    "   - Weekend pass conversion\n",
    "   - Cost-savings messaging\n",
    "   - Electric-bike membership tier adoption\n"

    "The May 2024 data suggests clear differences between member and casual behavior.\n",

    "- Members appear to use Cyclistic as a consistent transportation option.\n",
    "- Casual riders tend to ride less frequently but for longer durations, consistent with leisure usage.\n",

    "- long-ride casual riders\n",
    "- premium-bike casual riders\n",
